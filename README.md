## About

Official website: **https://libershare.com**

LiberShare is a peer-to-peer file sharing software built on modern decentralized technologies.

It introduces its own LISH network protocol and LISH data format for efficient and secure content distribution.

Unlike traditional peer-to-peer networks, LiberShare features a **decentralized database of shared files within each network**, combined with fine-grained access control. This makes it suitable for both public and private file sharing.
